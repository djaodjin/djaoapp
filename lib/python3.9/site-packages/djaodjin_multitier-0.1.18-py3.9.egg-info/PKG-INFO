Description: djaodjin-multitier is a Django application that implements shared tenancy.
        
        Major Features:
        
          - Dynamically select the following based on subdomain or path prefix:
              * Database connection
              * SMTP connection
              * Templates
          - URL resolvers: Dynamic path prefix (as a hack in i18n module)
        
        The [notes](http://djaodjin.com/blog/multi-tier-implementation-in-django.blog.html)
        of the presentation at a SF Django Meetup are useful to understand how
        middlewares, thread locals and template loaders were used to implement
        multi-tier applications here.
