Description: This code was written to simplify the generation of HTML emails and PDF
        outputs from templates.
        
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        After cloning the repository, create a virtualenv environment, install
        the prerequisites, configure the settings to your email server, then
        run the sendtestemail command.
        
            $ virtualenv-2.7 _installTop_
            $ source _installTop_/bin/activate
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
            $ make initdb
        
        Here you will need to edit credentials and site.conf to use the appropriate
        settings to connect to your e-mail server.
        
            credentials:
              EMAIL_HOST_USER =
              EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD =
            site.conf:
              EMAIL_HOST    =
              EMAIL_PORT    =
              EMAIL_USE_TLS =
              DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL =
        
        Then run the ``sendtestemail`` command and look for an e-mail delivered to you
        in HTML format.
        
            $ python manage.py sendtestemail __your_email_address__
        
        
        Note that you will need to link ``podofo-flatform.cc`` with [podofo](http://podofo.sourceforge.net/)
        version 0.9.3. Version 0.9.1 as shipped with Fedora 21 will link with no
        error but the outputed PDF will be blank.
