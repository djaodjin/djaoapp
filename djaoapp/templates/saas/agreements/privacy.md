General Privacy Statement
=========================

## Privacy Statement

Welcome to the {{organization.printable_name}} Privacy Statement. This is where
we describe how we handle your "Personal Data", which is information that is
directly linked or can be linked to you. It applies to the Personal Data that
{{organization.printable_name}} processes as the "Data Controller" when you
interact with websites, applications, and services that display this Statement
(collectively, "Services"). This Statement does not apply to services or
products that do not display this Statement where relevant.

### End User Notice: Organization-Provided {{organization.printable_name}} Accounts

When a school or employer supplies your {{organization.printable_name}} account,
they assume the role of Data Controller for most Personal Data used in our
Services. This enables them to:

- Manage and administer your {{organization.printable_name}} account,
including adjusting privacy settings.
- Access and utilize your Personal Data, which includes details on how you use
the Services, as well as your content and files.

Should you access a {{organization.printable_name}} Service through
an account provided by an organization, such as your employer or school,
the organization becomes the Data Controller, and this Privacy Statement's
direct applicability to you changes. Even so, {{organization.printable_name}}
remains dedicated to preserving your privacy rights. In such circumstances,
{{organization.printable_name}} functions as a Data Processor, adhering
to the Data Controller's instructions regarding your Personal Data's
processing. A contractual agreement governs the relationship between
{{organization.printable_name}} and the Data Controller. For further details
regarding their privacy practices, please refer to the privacy statement
of the organization providing your account.

In cases where your organization grants access to
{{organization.printable_name}} products, {{organization.printable_name}} acts
as the Data Controller solely for specific processing activities. These
activities are clearly defined in a contractual agreement with your
organization. For those limited purposes, this Statement
governs the handling of your Personal Data. For all other aspects of
{{organization.printable_name}} product usage, your organization's policies
apply.

### Third Party Access and Data Protection

links within our Services, the privacy policies of these third parties apply
to any Personal Data you provide or consent to share with them. Their privacy
statements will govern how this data is processed.

## Our use of cookies and tracking technologies

### Cookies and tracking technologies

{{organization.printable_name}} uses cookies to provide, secure and improve
our Service or to develop new features and functionality of our Service.
For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your
preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes,
including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile
statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future
development of {{organization.printable_name}}. We provide more information
about cookies set on {{organization.printable_name}} below that describes
the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies in
[Cookies and subprocessors](XXX).

For public pages, we may also use non-essential cookies to (i) gather
information about users’ interests and online activities to personalize their
experiences, including by making the ads, content, recommendations,
and marketing seen or received more relevant and (ii) serve and measure
the effectiveness of targeted advertising and other marketing efforts.
If you disable the non-essential cookies on the public pages, the ads,
content, and marketing you see may be less relevant.

Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image
that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP
address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications
more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends
on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will
only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay
until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period
applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie
collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data.


### What are cookies and similar technologies?

We use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage,
and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. When visiting
public pages, like blog pages, these and additional cookies, like advertising
IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.

Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie
can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain
that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and
letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other
information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser
over time, each time it connects to that web server.

Web beacons are electronic images (also called “single-pixel” or “clear GIFs”)
that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage
or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web
server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows
that web server to log information about your device and to set and read
its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites
(such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting
to the third-party web server that hosts that content.

Mobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile
devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies.
When visiting public pages, on a mobile device these may allow us and
our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales
and marketing purposes.

We may also use so-called "flash cookies" (also known as "Local Shared Objects"
or "LSOs") to collect and store information about your use of our Services.
Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.

#### How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?

The {{organization.printable_name}} Services use cookies and similar
technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and
settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your
interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill
other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be
provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners.
For example, our analytics and advertising partners may use these technologies
in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit,
the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device
information) related to your online activities over time and across Services
for various purposes, including targeted advertising.
{{organization.printable_name}} will place non-essential cookies on pages where
we market products and services to enterprise customers, for example,
blog pages.

We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with
third parties for these purposes.


#### What are your cookie choices and controls?

You have several options to disable non-essential cookies:

Some users will also be able to manage non-essential cookies via a cookie
consent banner, including the options to accept, manage, and reject
all non-essential cookies.

Generally for all websites You can control the cookies you encounter
on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:

- If your browser sends a Do Not Track (DNT) signal,
{{organization.printable_name}} will not set
non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set
non-essential cookies.
- Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies
you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn
more.
- If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, non-essential
cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.
- If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content,
non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent that content that
sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.
- Advertising controls. Our advertising partners may participate
in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting,
which you can access at:
  - United States: [NAI](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and [DAA](https://optout.aboutads.info/)
  - Canada: [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/)
  - Europe: [European Digital Advertising Alliance](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/)

These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our
Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems
to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.

In case, our services cannot infer your privacy settings through HTTP Headers,
the services will respect the settings provided in the following table:

| Enabled | Purpose | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| <input disabled type="checkbox" checked> | Required Cookies | {{organization.printable_name}} uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, provide a shopping cart experience, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work. |
| <input id="analytics" class="privacy-setting" type="checkbox"{% if analytics %} checked{% endif %}> | Analytics | We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how you use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages you visit and how many clicks you need to accomplish a task. We also use some analytics cookies to provide personalized advertising. |
| <input id="social_media" class="privacy-setting" type="checkbox"{% if social_media %} checked{% endif %}> | Social Media | {{organization.printable_name}} and third parties use social media cookies to show you ads and content based on your social media profiles and activity on {{organization.printable_name}}’s websites. This ensures that the ads and content you see on our websites and on social media will better reflect your interests. This also enables third parties to develop and improve their products, which they may use on websites that are not owned or operated by {{organization.printable_name}}. |
| <input id="advertising" class="privacy-setting" type="checkbox"{% if advertising %} checked{% endif %}> | Advertising | In addition, {{organization.printable_name}} and third parties use advertising cookies to show you new ads based on ads you've already seen. Cookies also track which ads you click or purchases you make after clicking an ad. This is done both for payment purposes and to show you ads that are more relevant to you. For example, cookies are used to detect when you click an ad and to show you ads based on your social media interests and website browsing history. |
